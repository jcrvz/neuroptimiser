\noindent The proposed neuromorphic optimisation algorithm exhibits computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N_{\text{steps}} \cdot \Lambda \cdot \mathcal{T}_{\text{eval}})$ for a complete simulation, where $N_{\text{steps}} = T_{\text{sim}}/\Delta t$ denotes the number of discrete timesteps, $\Lambda = 50$ represents the population size evaluated in parallel at each timestep, and $\mathcal{T}_{\text{eval}}$ characterises the objective function evaluation cost (typically $\mathcal{O}(D)$ to $\mathcal{O}(D^2)$ for $D$-dimensional problems). The per-timestep complexity decomposes into four principal components: state feature computation $\mathcal{O}(\mu D)$ where $\mu = 25$ is the memory size, basal ganglia operator selection $\mathcal{O}(N_{\text{neurons}}) \approx \mathcal{O}(1{,}200)$ executing in constant time on neuromorphic hardware, population generation $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda D)$, and fitness evaluation $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda \cdot \mathcal{T}_{\text{eval}})$ which dominates runtime (70--90\%). Spatial complexity is $\mathcal{O}((\mu + \Lambda)D) \approx \mathcal{O}(75D)$, requiring merely 6--60~KB for problems with $D \in [10, 100]$, substantially more compact than conventional evolutionary algorithms with populations of $\mathcal{O}(100D)$. The neural substrate comprises approximately 1{,}500 neurons and 4{,}500 synapses, occupying less than 2\% of a single Intel Loihi neuromorphic chip whilst providing energy efficiency improvements of 100--1{,}000$\times$ relative to conventional processors. Critically, the algorithm exhibits excellent parallelisation characteristics: fitness evaluation and population generation are embarrassingly parallel, yielding theoretical speedups approaching $50\times$ on massively parallel architectures, whilst the event-driven neural selection mechanism executes in hardware-constant time irrespective of problem dimensionality. For typical continuous optimisation benchmarks, expected complexity is $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda D^{3/2} \log D)$, competitive with state-of-the-art metaheuristics whilst offering superior hardware efficiency and adaptive operator selection with negligible computational overhead.
