Welcome to neurOptimiser's Documentation
========================================

**neurOptimiser** is a neuromorphic optimisation framework built upon spiking neural dynamics and heuristic search principles. It enables the design and evaluation of decentralised, asynchronous metaheuristic processes inspired by biological computation.

This documentation is intended for developers, researchers, and contributors interested in understanding the internals of neurOptimiser, extending its capabilities, or integrating it into other systems.

.. note::
   This project is under active development.

Structure of this Documentation
-------------------------------
This documentation is organised into the following main sections:

- **Modules Overview**: A high-level description of the internal modules that constitute the neurOptimiser framework.
- **API Reference**: Automatically generated reference for all public classes, functions, and modules. This includes docstrings, inheritance structure, and usage hints.
- **Usage Examples** (coming soon): Practical examples on how to instantiate and run neurOptimiser simulations, define spiking models, and configure custom heuristics.
- **Developer Notes** (coming soon): Guidelines for contributing to the project, including style conventions, branching strategy, and testing.

Getting Started
---------------

To begin using neurOptimiser:

1. Install the framework locally or via a package manager (see README).
2. Import and instantiate `Neuroptimiser` or its components.
3. Configure your problem, neural model, and metaheuristic parameters.
4. Run and evaluate your simulations.

If you're new to neuromorphic computing or heuristic search, we recommend starting with the Examples section once it's available.
